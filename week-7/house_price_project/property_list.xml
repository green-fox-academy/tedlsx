    <description>IntroductionGreat Nurcott comes to the market following the Vendor's recent decision to dissolve the farming partnership, the property having been occupied by the same family for over 100 years. This sale thereby affords potential purchasers an extremely rare opportunity to acquire an outstanding residential and commercial livestock holding occupying an exceptional position within the unspoilt countryside of the Exmoor National Park, providing considerable sporting and amenity appeal.DirectionsFrom Taunton take the A358 in a north westerly direction towards Minehead and after about 6 miles turn left onto the B3224 sign posted Elworthy and Ralegh's Cross. Follow this road for about 5.5 miles and at Elworthy Cross continue straight over into the Exmoor National Park. After passing the Ralegh's Cross Inn continue for about 0.6 miles and bear right beside the Brendon Hills Methodist Church, remaining on the B3224 towards Wheddon Cross. Follow this road for about 7 miles into Wheddon Cross and turn left. Stay on this road for about 3 miles before turning right for Winsford. Upon reaching Winsford continue straight through the village heading for Exford and Simonsbath whereupon the entrance drive to Great Nurcott will be found approximately 1 mile along this road on the right hand side.SituationThe property is situated in a sought after part of the picturesque Exmoor National Park accessed over a long private drive in a south facing position, enjoying outstanding views over the surrounding countryside. The setting is superb, lying well positioned within its own land in some of the most attractive countryside in the county comprising a beautiful and varied landscape primarily dominated by traditional agriculture interspersed with charming villages and farmsteads, with an abundance of pasture, woodland and open moor.Whilst the setting is rural the property still enjoys easy access to the surrounding districts, being within convenient driving distance of the popular Exmoor villages and towns of Winsford, Exford and Dulverton. Winsford itself is an extremely pretty village providing a parish church, village hall, post office/village stores, restaurant, and village cricket club, whilst the nearby A396 provides a useful link to Minehead, Dulverton, Bampton and Tiverton. The larger towns of Minehead and Dulverton offer a more comprehensive range of everyday shopping, banking and scholastic facilities, including primary and middle schools. Secondary schooling is available at Minehead or Wiveliscombe, with independent schools at Taunton, Wellington, West Buckland and Tiverton.Access to the M5 motorway is available at Taunton (J25), as well as Wellington (J26) and Tiverton (J27). Main line stations at Taunton and Tiverton Parkway provide a fast rail service to London (Paddington) with international airports available at Bristol and Exeter.Sporting and RecreationIn itself the property occupies a position within south west England renowned for both the diversity of its countryside and for the many varied sporting and recreational facilities available, either within the immediate vicinity or further afield. The Exmoor National Park boasts an abundance of foot and bridle paths and hunting may be enjoyed with several noted packs. For the equestrian inclined there are numerous active pony clubs in the area, point-to-points, polo clubs and National Hunt Steeplechase meetings held regularly at the Taunton Racecourse.
